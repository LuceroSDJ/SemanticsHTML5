# SemanticsHTML5
A deeper understanding of a markup language and programming languages expands your horizon of opportunities allowing you to build a stronger foundation of your knowledge.

Let's learn a valuable piece of knowledge at a time!

## Understanding Semantics HTML5:
HTML is a markup language used to tell the browser how to display the content on the page. It consists of non-semantic HTML tags and semantic HTML5 tags.

Unlike non-semantic HTML tags, semantic HTML5 tags tell the browser what TYPE OF CONTENT they contain and what role it plays in the page. 
```
Example:
<div> Text </div>               <header> Text </header>
<div> Text </div>      vs.      <article> Text </article>
<div> Text </div>               <footer> Text </footer>
```
In the example above, <div> tags serve only as text holders. On the other hand, <header>, <article>, and <footer> tags specifically indicate the type of content they contain, which makes it easier to indentify the structure and organization of the page.

## Basic HTML5 skeleton file
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <heade>...</header>
    <article>
        <section></section>
    </article>
    <footer>...</footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Understanding head tag
```
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
```
        UTF-8 (U from Universal Character Set + Transformation Formatâ€”8-bit) 
        is a character encoding capable of encoding all possible characters 
        (called code points) in Unicode. The encoding is variable-length and uses 8-bit code units.
```
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=2.0">
```
        HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, through the <meta> tag.
        A <meta> viewport element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

```
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
```  
        The X-UA-Compatible meta tag allows web authors to choose what version of Internet Explorer the page should be rendered as. 
        If you need to support IE9 or IE8, then it is recommended to the tag. -Stack overflow
